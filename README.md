# Docker for AI — Lightweight, Fast, and Clean

This repository demonstrates Docker optimization techniques for AI/ML applications through practical examples and iterative improvements.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to take a simple AI inference application, a Python script using the `transformers` library and a pre-trained BERT model for text classification, and iteratively optimize its Docker containerization step-by-step.

The core application code remains stable at the top level of the repository. Each optimization technique focuses on a specific Docker optimization approach, and the corresponding subdirectory contains the `Dockerfile` (and sometimes modified requirements files) that implements that technique, building upon previous optimizations.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to keep core application code in a single location while demonstrating different Docker optimization approaches.

*   `naive_image/`: Contains the initial, unoptimized Docker implementation as a baseline.
*   `slim_image/`: Contains optimized Dockerfile demonstrating base image optimization.
*   `multistage_image/`: Contains Dockerfile implementing multi-stage builds.
*   `layered_image/`: Contains Dockerfile illustrating RUN command chaining and layer optimization.
*   `distroless_image/`: Contains Dockerfile using Google's distroless images for maximum security.
*   `models_image/`: Contains Dockerfile exploring model management strategies within Docker.
